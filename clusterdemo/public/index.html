    <p>
      The list below shows all of the nodes currently connected to the cluster.
      There is no master/woker or master/slave relationship between any of the
      nodes. They are all peers, and all auto-discover the state of the cluster
      periodically. Killing a node causes all nodes to be updated with the 
      current state of the cluster. Likewise, starting a new node does the same.
    </p>

    <p>
      To kill a node on the cluster, click its ID. It will be killed immediately,
      and within a few seconds, the list should update itself accordingly.
      To add a new node to the cluster, click the button.
