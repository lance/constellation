A simple application that uses Aquila to create a mesh of several nodes, then
serves a basic HTML page showing all nodes in the cluster. On that page, you
can start new nodes or kill existing ones and watch the list of cluster members
update automagically in real time.


To run the application

    $ npm install ../
    $ node .

Then browse to http://localhost:3000
