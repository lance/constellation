# Clustered messaging bus inspired by JGroups

## Usage

This is experimental and under constant change. There is no point in a "Usage"
section until things stabilize a bit more. But if you're interested...

## How to Build

The project is built with `grunt`. Simply running `grunt` in the local
directory will execute the default task, including jshint, tests, and docs. To
run just the tests: `grunt mochaTest`. To check your source for lint, run
`grunt jshint`. To generate docs, run `grunt doxx`.
